# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
Message:
i-0ab3904ba20f41a76 is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.61. Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information?

AWS GuardDuty can monitor CloudTrail, DNS, and VPC flow logs to identify suspicious activity. 
A few examples of activity that GuardDuty can identify:

	- SSH brute force attempts.
	- API calls from IP addresses that are on threat lists.
	- Traffic that is destined for crypto-currency related IPs from an EC2 instance.
		
To detect the SSH brute attack, AWS GuardDuty will analyze the source & destination traffic data using the VPC Flow logs. 
VPC Flow logs will have information on both the traffic going into and from the EC2 network interfaces.
